# Frogger---Classic-Arcade-Game
Recreation of the Classic Arcade Game: Frogger

This project was created using C# and Unity. It showcases player input for movement, enemy collisions, life counter, scene switches, sound effect/music, and custom graphics. 

After completing the Tech Academy's C# and Unity Course of the Game Developer Bootcamp, I collaborated with my fellow students for two weeks to develop full-scale classic arcade games using the aformentioned software. Working on a piece of a larger project provided a great learning environment for working within an existing product, and experience integrating my work into the larger product. I got to operate in the capacity of a professional developer, and experience how they work with the time, resources, and customer stories they have. Since each person worked on a different game, I got to develop every back-end and front-end detail of my game. I am extremely proud I get to say that virtually every aspect of Frogger is my own work. I learned the value of utilizing my resources to the fullest extent to complete my project, including using my instructor, who helped me through many bugs and Unity issues. Over the two week sprint, I also had the opportunity to work on project management and team programming skills that I'm confident and excited to use on future projects.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets code files, and final product images.
